# Simplified PageRank Algorithm

### In this project, we are required to implement a simplified version of the original PageRank algorithm on which Google was built by representing the web as a graph and implementing this graph using an Adjacency List or an equivalent data structure. The PageRank algorithm is an algorithm that is used to order or rank different web pages on the internet.
